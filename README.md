# INST408F: Special Topics in Information Science: Health Analytics

In this class, we used R to analyze various health datasets. For this final project, myself and 3 others worked together to answer questions about the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Because the file is very large, I am providing the link to the page to download it. You will download the SAS version: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2018.html.

The question I was interested in answering was
- How well do factors such as race, educational attainment, and the number of days a respondentâ€™s mental health was poor predict what age a respondent is diagnosed with cancer?

The code I have provided demonstrates how I cleaned the data and ran a multiple linear regression. You can read my interpretation of the results in the presentation titled "INST408F: Final Presentation" (slides 22-37).
